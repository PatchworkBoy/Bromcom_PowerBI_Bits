# Bromcom_PowerBI_Bits
Repo into which I can dump PowerQuery and other associated bits to do with ingesting Bromcom CloudMIS / Vision data into semantic models / Fabric.

For useful PowerQuery function code see the Connector_Functions folder.

For chunked retrieval of date-ranged historic tables, see Dateranged Tables.pbit PowerBI Template.
